== KNative Eventing

Our next component is the one that will subscribe to the Kafka Topic, and forward the messages to the Service we just created. +

The definition file basically says: subscribe to this topic from this Kafka cluster, and send events to this Service.

=== Creation

The file 11_kafkasource-risk-assessment.yaml must be edited to fill-in the correct namespace, `{GUID}`

You can do it manually, or just run this command:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/namespace_replace_me/{GUID}/g' 11_kafkasource-risk-assessment.yaml
----

You can now apply the file:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 11_kafkasource-risk-assessment.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, navigate to Workloads->Pods, and wait for the pod `kafkasource-xray-images-xxxx` to be in the Running state.
