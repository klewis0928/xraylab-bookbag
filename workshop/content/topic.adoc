== Kafka Topic

This is the "channel" where our bucket notifications will be sent. We will still use the AMQ Streams operator to easily create it (see how useful an operator is?).

=== Creation

Still nothing to modify here. Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 07_topics.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, you can navigate to Operators->Installed Operators->Red Hat Integration - AMQ streams, and select the Kafka Topic tab. `xray-images` should be listed. +
We will also see another method to verify this in the next step.
