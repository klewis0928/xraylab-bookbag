== Let's go...

It's now time to launch our demo!

As explained before, the only thing we have to do is to scale up the image-generator, and it will begin to copy images in our base bucket, which will start the pipeline. +
There are two ways to do that.

=== Through the console

On the console, in your main project ({GUID}), navigate to Workloads->Deployment Configs, select `image-generator`. On the `Details` tab, scale it up to one instance.

=== Through the CLI

You can directly patch the Deployment Config with this command:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc scale deploymentconfig/image-generator --replicas=1
----

=== And now?

Just go to the Grafana dashboard which should still be opened on one of your browser tab (it should be `https://grafana-route-{GUID}.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}`), and you should see the pipeline running!
