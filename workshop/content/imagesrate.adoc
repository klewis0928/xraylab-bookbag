== How to increase the image production rate

If we want to load the pipeline some more and make our Service scale up, we can patch the image-generator with a lower value for variable `seconds_wait` (this is the waiting time between images). We can double the rate for example by setting it to 0.5.

IMPORTANT: Please do not leave this setting more than a few minutes to make sure you don't fill up the cluster with thousands of copies of images... Please revert to the initial setting or stop the demo (last module). 

=== Through the console

On the console, in your main project ({GUID}), navigate to Workloads->Deployment Configs, select `image-generator`, and go to the Environment tab.

Change the `SECONDS_WAIT` parameter from 1 to 0.5, and click *Save* at the bottom.

This will redeploy the image generator pod with the new configuration.

=== Through the CLI

You can directly patch the Deployment Config with this command:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc patch dc image-generator --type=json -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value","value":"0.5"}]'
----

=== And now?

Just go to the Grafana dashboard which should still be opened on one of your browser tab (it should be `https://grafana-route-{GUID}.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}`), and see the change!
