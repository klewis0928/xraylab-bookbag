== Grafana Images Dashboard

This is the definition of the dashboard that displays the large versions of the images. +

And this is a little bit tricky... With the Grafana operator, dashboard definitions are stored in a JSON string where it's not easy to use variables or parameters, like the namespace we are in. So this time our source file is a template that must be processed first before being applied.

=== Creation

Have a look at the file (if you want, this one is pretty long and complicated), and process/apply it. The two parameters that have to be processed in the template are:

* image_server_url: the route to the image server deployment. It’s the external route that your browser will directly connect to, to retrieve and display the images.

* bucket_base_name: the bucket base name you are using for this lab. It’s used to form the location of the image to retrieve.

Originally the command would look like:
`oc process -f 14_grafana-xraylab-images-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=<replace_me> -p bucket_base_name=<replace_me> | oc apply -f -`

But if you have followed my instructions and kept the bucket_base_name to be your main project name, `{GUID}`, the command should directly be:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc process -f 14_grafana-xraylab-images-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=https://image-server-{GUID}.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN} -p bucket_base_name={GUID} | oc apply -f -
----

=== Verification

In the Console, you can navigate to Operators->Installed Operators->Grafana Operator, and select the Grafana Dashboard tab. `xraylab-images-dashboard` should be listed.
