== Image Generator

Of course, we won't _generate_ XRay images for this demo. +
Instead, this component will copy randomly chosen source XRay images hosted in a public bucket (from around 600 images) to our ODF incoming bucket. +

NOTE: The initial generator DeploymentConfig is scaled down to zero. That's normal as we want to finish deploying all the components before starting the demo. Leave it like this for the moment.

=== Creation

Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 12_dc-image-generator.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, navigate to Workloads->DeploymentConfigs and check that `image-generator` is there with a status of `0 of 0 pods`. Don't scale it up yet, you'll do that when the pipeline is fully ready (if you start it anyway it will just CrashLoop until the buckets are ready, which is done later).
