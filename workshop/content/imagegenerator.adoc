== Image Generator

Of course, we won't _generate_ XRay images for this demo. +
Instead, this component will copy randomly chosen source XRay images hosted in a public bucket (from around 600 images) to our ODF incoming bucket. +

The initial generator DeploymentConfig is scaled down to zero. That's normal as we want to deploy all the components before starting the demo. Leave it like this for the moment.

=== Creation

Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 12_dc-image-generator.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, navigate to Workloads->Pods, and wait for the pod `image-generator-xxxxx` to be in the Running state.
